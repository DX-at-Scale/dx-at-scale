# Welcome to DX at Scale: Your gateway to scalable digital transformation
Helping enterprises solve complex digital transformation challenges by offering high-quality, open-source articles.

## What is Digital Transformation (DX)?
Digital Transformation is the process of leveraging technology and guiding people to enhance business operations, improve customer experiences, and drive innovation, enabling organizations to adapt and thrive in a digital-first world.

## What is this initiative for?
Access to information about Digital Transformation is not sufficiently democratized on the web. Large consulting firms tend to keep their insights and experiences hidden to monetize their expertise. 

As a result, there is little space for open discussion, and the open-source community lacks initiatives that unite consultants from different companies to provide high-quality contents. 

Such contents could help democratize information about Digital Transformation, including experiences, lessons learned, tools, and methodologies.
